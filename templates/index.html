                Over the past few decades, the emergence of electric vehicles has begun to revolutionize the carbon footprints of the average driver.
                With a healthy alternative to gas vehicles, it has never been easier to do your part to lower your individual carbon footprint... 
                <br><br>
                Or has it?
                <br><br>
                The sort answer is yes, it has. But by how much? The energy that is used in EV charging stations has to be sourced from somewhere. Electricity
                for EV charging stations is sourced from the local grids. Local grids source their electricity from local power plants, and depending on how
                powerplants produce their energy, can still come with a high carbon footprint.<br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><br>
                The image above exposes the high presence of harmful energy sources fuelling energy grids. Electric vehicle drivers may believe they are
                protecting the atmostphere better than their gasoline-consuming counterparts - but could be sourcing energy from
                a coal plant feeding into high levels of carbon emissions.
                <br><br>
                With this problem comes opportunity for optimization. This project aims to identify the most potentially "dirty" charging stations that source 
                their energy from harmful sources. By identifying these harmful stations, new routes can be suggested to EV drivers to target more eco-friendly
                charging stations on their trips while minimizing additional time. This optimization problem is what we set out to solve.
